<h3>Who Is Mr. Bill?</h3>

<img src="fredbill.jpg" alt="A portrait of Frederic Bill" class="bodyimg">

<p class="textleft">Frederic Bill was born in 1833. As a young boy Mr. Bill lived and went to school in our area and he grew up to become a schoolteacher, a bookseller, a publisher, and eventually a businessman in New York City. He retired at the age of 40 and returned to his hometown of Groton, where he bought a farm near the Thames River.</p>

<p class="textleft">Besides the library, Mr. Bill gave money to help build the Groton Congregational Church, which is just down the street from the library, and in 1912 he paid for the new Groton Heights Elementary School, which is right next door.</p>
